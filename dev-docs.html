            <!-- Overview -->
            <h1>Developer Overview</h1>

            <p>
                Toothless gives native app developers what web developers have had for years: a user-friendly distribution system. Create a Docker container with your application, make it compatible with Toothless with a few lines in your Dockerfile, and push it to Docker Hub. Distributing your application is now as simple as posting a link.
            </p>

            <p>
                Toothless does not spurn the web, however. You can create client-side servers with browser frontends, allowing you to run native code to back up your user's frontend experience. See Tutorial #1 for an example of this.
            </p>

            <!-- TUTORIAL 1 -->
            <h1>Tutorial #1: Hello World!</h1>

            <p>We'll start off with a simple Python web server that echos "Hello World!" to the browser.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                <h4>Prerequisite: Install Docker</h4>
                <p>
                    You'll need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/">install Docker</a> to complete these tutorials. The recommended version is currently 1.5.0.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                <h4>Prerequisite: Docker Hub account</h4>
                <p>
                    To fully complete these tutorials, you'll need a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> account. The image name <code>toothless/helloworld</code> will not be available to you; you'll need to use <code>[your docker hub account name]/helloworld.</code>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Build the server</h3>
            Here's the code for the web server, <code>app.py</code>:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
#!/usr/bin/env python

from bottle import route, run

# Simulate slow startup.
import time
time.sleep(5);

@route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
</pre>            

            <p>We're serving "Hello World!" on port 8080. Before we start listening, we add a pause of 5 seconds to simulate
            work the server needs to do before it can start responding to requests.</p>

            <h3>Create the Dockerfile</h3>

            <p>Next we'll create a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/">Dockerfile</a> for our app:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
# Use the python base image
FROM ubuntu 

# Install Python and the bottle webserver.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python-bottle

# Copy our application into /app in the container.
ADD app /app

# Expose port 8080. Toothless will automatically publish
# this port to a random port on the host.
EXPOSE 8080

# Indicate that this is a toothless app.
ENV toothless=true

# We want only one instance of this app running at any given time.
ENV toothless_singleton=true

# Provide an endpoint for Toothless to check to see if the app is ready.
ENV toothless_ready_port=8080
ENV toothless_ready_endpoint=/

# Tell Toothless where to redirect the user when they go to the app.
ENV toothless_redirect_port=8080
ENV toothless_redirect_endpoint=/

# When our app starts up, go to the /app directory and run ./app.py
WORKDIR /app
CMD ./app.py
</pre>

            
            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Dockerfile ENV</h4>
                <p>Toothless uses Dockerfile <code>ENV</code> environment variables to define the behavior of an app.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Singletons</h4>
                <p>A singleton is an application that is limited to a single instance. This is useful for clientside webservers
                or other applications where the developer does not want multiple simultaneous instances. Normal desktop applications
                would not use this feature. The singleton state is enabled with the <code>ENV toothless_singleton=true</code> 
                Dockerfile environment variable definition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Toothless Ready & Redirect</h4>
                <p>Immediately after an application container has been started, Toothless will continuously hit the endpoint defined by 
                <code>toothless_ready_endpoint</code> and <code>toothless_ready_port</code>, if they are defined. Once this 
                endpoint returns a status 200, the user will be redirected to the endpoint defined by 
                <code>toothless_redirect_endpoint</code> and <code>toothless_redirect_port</code>, if they are defined.
            </div>

            <h3>Project organization</h3>

            <p>Let's put these files into their own directory, organized thus:</p>

<pre>
toothless-helloworld/
├── app
│   └── app.py
└── Dockerfile
</pre>            

            <h3>Build and push our application</h3>

            <p>Next we'll <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build">build</a> our application image:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker build -t toothless/helloworld:latest .
</pre>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Docker Build</h4>
                <p>Be sure to check out the documentation on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build">docker build</a>
                so that you understand what is going on with the image tagging here. You won't be able to use toothless/helloworld.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Finally, let's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#push">push</a>
            it to Docker Hub (you'll need an account there if you don't already have one):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker push toothless/helloworld:latest
</pre>            

            <h3>App launch</h3>

            <p>The user can launch the app by clicking a link. Here's what that link looks like for this app: 
            <a href="http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/helloworld" target="_blank">
                http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/helloworld</a>.
            Clicking this link will redirect the user to the Toothless server on their host, which will take over the launch 
            of the application.</p>

            <img src="img/hello-world.png" class="img-responsive img50p center-block mtop32">

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Application updates</h4>
                <p>If an application has no running instances when it is launched, Toothless will always try to 
                    pull the application image before launching it. This is done so that if you need to change the
                    structure of stored data from one version of your application to the next, you will not need to
                    be concerned that an incompatible instance is simultaneously accessing that data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Application updates</h4>
                <p>Toothless will always pull the <code>:latest</code> version of your image. Versioning is not yet supported.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- TUTORIAL 2 -->
            <h1>Tutorial #2: Firefox with X11 and PulseAudio support</h1>

            <p>This tutorial will demonstrate how to set up a typical desktop application with X11 and Pulseaudio support by
            launching an instance of Firefox and opening a music video on YouTube.</p>

            <p>All we'll need for this application is a Dockerfile:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
# Use the Ubuntu base image.
FROM ubuntu

# Install Firefox and PulseAudio
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y firefox
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y pulseaudio

# We'll need a user for X11 support.
RUN useradd -m toothless

# Indicate that this is a toothless application.
ENV toothless=true

# More than one instance of this can be run at once.
ENV toothless_singleton=false

# Enable X11 and PulseAudio support.
ENV toothless_x11=true
ENV toothless_pulseaudio=true

# When the container launches, switch to the toothless user.
USER toothless

# Launch a new instance Firefox and open a music video.
CMD firefox -new-instance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqckaTq9oW8 
</pre>

            <p>The remaining steps are nearly identical to the Hello World! example. Start by setting up 
            the application directory thus:</p>

<pre>
toothless-firefox/
└── Dockerfile
</pre>

            <p>Then build the image:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker build -t toothless/firefox:latest .
</pre>

            <p>And finally push the image:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker push toothless/firefox:latest            
</pre>

            <p>The application can be launched via the link
            <a href="http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/firefox" target="_blank">
                http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/firefox</a>.

            <!-- REFERENCE -->

            <h1>Reference</h1>

            <h2>Dockerfile</h2>

            <div class="env" style="margin-top:32px">ENV toothless=true</div>

            <p>
                Indicates that this application is a Toothless app. Toothless will not launch images that do
                not have this set to true.
            </p>

            <div class="env">ENV toothless_singleton=true/false</div>

            <p>
                If true, Toothless will not launch a new instance of this application if one is already running.
                Use in conjunction with <code>toothless_redirect_endpoint/port</code> to build a standard webapp
                with a clientside server.
            </p>

            <div class="env">
                ENV toothless_ready_endpoint=string<br>
                ENV toothless_ready_port=integer
            </div>

            <p>
                If these values are set, Toothless will continuously hit the endpoint defined by <code>toothless_ready_endpoint/port</code>,
                waiting for a status 200  before redirecting to <code>toothless_redirect_endpoint/port</code> or 
                indicating that the app has been launched (see <code>toothless_indicate_ready</code>). If these values are not set,
                the app will be considered ready immediately after the container starts.
            </p>

            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>
                <code>ENV toothless_ready_endpoint=/_toothless/ready</code><br>
                <code>ENV toothless_ready_port=8080</code>
            </p>
            <p>Toothless would check <code>http://localhost:8080/_toothless/ready</code> in the container.</p>

            <div class="env">
                ENV toothless_redirect_endpoint=string<br>
                ENV toothless_redirect_port=integer
            </div>
            <p>
                If these values are set, Toothless will redirect the user's browser to the indicated endpoint after the application
                has been determined to be ready.
            </p>

            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>
                <code>ENV toothless_redirect_endpoint=/index.html</code><br>
                <code>ENV toothless_redirect_port=8080</code>
            </p>
            <p>Toothless would redirect the user to <code>http://localhost:8080/index.html</code> in the container.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Port publishing</h4>
                <p>
                    The port that the user is redirected to is not actually the one supplied; Toothless publishes the provided
                    port to a random one on the host, and redirects there.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="env">ENV toothless_indicate_ready=integer</div>
            <p>
                If this is set and the user has not been redirected via <code>toothless_redirect_endpoint/port</code>, the booting page
                will display a message indicating that the application has been started. This can be used for background services that
                do not have a user-facing webpage.
            </p>

            <div class="env">ENV toothless_x11=true/false</div>
            <p>
                If this is set to true, X11 support will be enabled for the application.
            </p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>X11</h4>
                <p>
                    Note that a user must be set and in use for X11 support to work. See Tutorial #2 for an example.
                </p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>PulseAudio</h4>
                <p>
                    Be sure to install the <code>pulseaudio</code> package in your container, or this may not work.

                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Toothless URLs</h2>

            <p>Links for launching Toothless applications are of the form <code>http://localhost:9887/app?repo=application/name</code>
                where <code>application/name</code> is the name of your image on Docker Hub, e.g., <code>toothless/helloworld</code>.

            <h2>Data storage</h2>
            <p>Every application is given access to two persistent data stores. The application-specific data should be
                stored in <code>/toothless/local</code>, while data to be shared with other Toothless applications should
                be written to <code>/toothless/shared</code>. These two paths can be found on the host in 
                <code>/opt/toothless/app-data/[application-name]</code> and <code>/opt/toothless/app-data/shared</code>.
                Note that while other Toothless applications do not have access to application-specific data, the user
                can read and write this data at any time, whether your application is running or not.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Persistent data</h4>
                <p>
                    Containers are discarded after they exit, so any data written anywhere other than <code>/toothless/local</code>
                    or <code>/toothless/shared</code> will be lost. Do not store important data elsewhere!
