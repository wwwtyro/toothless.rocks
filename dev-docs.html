            <h1>Tutorial #1: Hello World!</h1>

            <p>We'll start off with a simple Python web server that echos "Hello World!" to
            the browser.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                <h4>Prerequisite: Docker Hub account</h4>
                <p>To fully complete this tutorial, you'll need a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> account. 
                    The image name <code>toothless/helloworld</code> will not be available to you; you'll need to use 
                    <code>[your docker hub account name]/helloworld.</code></p>
            </div>

            <h3>Build the server</h3>
            Here's the code for the web server, <code>app.py</code>:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
#!/usr/bin/env python

from bottle import route, run

# Simulate slow startup.
import time
time.sleep(5);

@route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
</pre>            

            <p>We're serving "Hello World!" on port 8080. Before we start listening, we add a pause of 5 seconds to simulate
            work the server needs to do before it can start responding to requests.</p>

            <h3>Create the Dockerfile</h3>

            <p>Next we'll create a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/">Dockerfile</a> for our app:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
# Use the python base image
FROM ubuntu 

# Install Python and the bottle webserver.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python-bottle

# Copy our application into /app in the container.
ADD app /app

# Expose port 8080. Toothless will automatically publish
# this port to a random port on the host.
EXPOSE 8080

# Indicate that this is a toothless app.
ENV toothless=true

# We want only one instance of this app running at any given time.
ENV toothless_singleton=true

# Provide an endpoint for Toothless to check to see if the app is ready.
ENV toothless_ready_port=8080
ENV toothless_ready_endpoint=/

# Tell Toothless where to redirect the user when they go to the app.
ENV toothless_redirect_port=8080
ENV toothless_redirect_endpoint=/

# When our app starts up, go to the /app directory and run ./app.py
WORKDIR /app
CMD ./app.py
</pre>

            
            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Dockerfile ENV</h4>
                <p>Toothless uses Dockerfile <code>ENV</code> environment variables to define the behavior of an app.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Singletons</h4>
                <p>A singleton is an application that is limited to a single instance. This is useful for clientside webservers
                or other applications where the developer does not want multiple simultaneous instances. Normal desktop applications
                would not use this feature. The singleton state is enabled with the <code>ENV toothless_singleton=true</code> 
                Dockerfile environment variable definition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Toothless Ready & Redirect</h4>
                <p>Immediately after an application container has been started, Toothless will continuously hit the endpoint defined by 
                <code>toothless_ready_endpoint</code> and <code>toothless_ready_port</code>, if they are defined. Once this 
                endpoint returns a status 200, the user will be redirected to the endpoint defined by 
                <code>toothless_redirect_endpoint</code> and <code>toothless_redirect_port</code>, if they are defined.
            </div>

            <h3>Project organization</h3>

            <p>Let's put these files into their own directory, organized thus:</p>

<pre>
toothless-helloworld/
├── app
│   └── app.py
└── Dockerfile
</pre>            

            <h3>Build and push our application</h3>

            <p>Next we'll <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build">build</a> our application image:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker build -t toothless/helloworld:latest .
</pre>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Docker Build</h4>
                <p>Be sure to check out the documentation on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build">docker build</a>
                so that you understand what is going on with the image tagging here. You won't be able to use toothless/helloworld.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Finally, let's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#push">push</a>
            it to Docker Hub (you'll need an account there if you don't already have one):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker push toothless/helloworld:latest
</pre>            

            <h3>App launch</h3>

            <p>The user can launch the app by clicking a link. Here's what that link looks like for this app: 
            <a href="http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/helloworld" target="_blank">
                http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/helloworld</a>.
            Clicking this link will redirect the user to the Toothless server on their host, which will take over the launch 
            of the application. See the application booting section for details on how that works.</p>

            <h1>Tutorial #2: Firefox with X11 and PulseAudio support</h1>

            <p>This tutorial will demonstrate how to set up a typical desktop application with X11 and Pulseaudio support by
            launching an instance of Firefox and opening a music video on YouTube.</p>

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Firefox in Docker containers</h4>
                <p>If Firefox is already running on the host, the process will be run on the host, not in the container! To test
                this tutorial properly, shut down Firefox before launching the application.</p>
            </div>

            <p>All we'll need for this application is a Dockerfile:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
# Use the Ubuntu base image.
FROM ubuntu

# Install Firefox and PulseAudio
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y firefox
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y pulseaudio

# We'll need a user for X11 support.
RUN useradd -m toothless

# Indicate that this is a toothless application.
ENV toothless=true

# More than one instance of this can be run at once.
ENV toothless_singleton=false

# Enable X11 and PulseAudio support.
ENV toothless_X11=true
ENV toothless_PULSEAUDIO=true

# When the container launches, switch to the toothless user.
USER toothless

# Launch Firefox and open a music video.
CMD firefox https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqckaTq9oW8 
</pre>

            <p>The remaining steps are nearly identical to the Hello World! example. Start by setting up 
            the application directory thus:</p>

<pre>
toothless-firefox/
└── Dockerfile
</pre>

            <p>Then build the image:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker build -t toothless/firefox:latest .
</pre>

            <p>And finally push the image:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker push toothless/firefox:latest            
</pre>

            <p>The application can be launched via the link
            <a href="http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/firefox" target="_blank">
                http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/firefox</a>.
