            <h1>Tutorial #1: Hello World!</h1>

            <p>We'll start off with a simple Python web server that echos "Hello World!" to
            the browser.</p>

            <h3>Build the server</h3>
            Here's the code for the web server, <code>app.py</code>:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
#!/usr/bin/env python

from bottle import route, run

# Simulate slow startup.
import time
time.sleep(5);

@route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
</pre>            

            <p>We're serving "Hello World!" on port 8080. Before we start listening, we add a pause of 5 seconds to simulate
            work the server needs to do before it can start responding to requests.</p>

            <h3>Create the Dockerfile</h3>

            <p>Next we'll create a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/">Dockerfile</a> for our app:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
# Use the python base image
FROM ubuntu 

# Install Python and the bottle webserver.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python-bottle

# Copy our application into /app in the container.
ADD app /app

# Expose port 8080. Toothless will automatically publish
# this port to a random port on the host.
EXPOSE 8080

# Indicate that this is a toothless app.
ENV toothless=true

# We want only one instance of this app running at any given time.
ENV toothless_singleton=true

# Provide an endpoint for Toothless to check to see if the app is ready.
ENV toothless_ready_port=8080
ENV toothless_ready_endpoint=/

# Tell Toothless where to redirect the user when they go to the app.
ENV toothless_redirect_port=8080
ENV toothless_redirect_endpoint=/

# When our app starts up, go to the /app directory and run ./app.py
WORKDIR /app
CMD ./app.py
</pre>

            
            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>ENV</h4>
                <p>Toothless uses Dockerfile <code>ENV</code> environment variables to define the behavior of an app.</p>
            </div>

            <p>When the user attempts to launch our app, Toothless will check to see if the app is already running, and if so,
            redirect to it. If the app is not yet running, the user will be redirected to a booting page that will tell them
            the status of the booting process. Once the container is running, Toothless will continuously hit the endpoint
            defined by <code>toothless_ready_endpoint</code> and <code>toothless_ready_port</code>. Once this endpoint returns
            a status 200, the user will be redirected to the endpoint defined by <code>toothless_redirect_endpoint</code> and 
            <code>toothless_redirect_port</code>.

            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
                <h4>Singletons</h4>
                <p>A singleton is an application that is limited to a single instance. This is useful for clientside webservers
                or other applications where the developer does not want multiple simultaneous instances. Normal desktop applications
                would not use this feature. The singleton state is enabled with the <code>ENV toothless_singleton=true</code> 
                Dockerfile environment variable definition.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Project organization</h3>

            <p>Let's put these files into their own directory, organized thus:</p>

<pre>
toothless-helloworld/
├── app
│   └── app.py
└── Dockerfile
</pre>            

            <h3>Build and push our application</h3>

            <p>Next we'll <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build">build</a> our application image.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker build -t toothless/helloworld:latest .
</pre>

            <p>Be sure to check out the documentation on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build">docker build</a>
            so that you understand what is going on with the image tagging here. You won't be able to use toothless/helloworld.</p>

            <p>Finally, let's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#push">push</a>
            it to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> (you'll need an account there if you don't already have one):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo docker push toothless/helloworld:latest
</pre>            

            <h3>App launch</h3>

            <p>The user can launch the app by clicking a link. Here's what that link looks like for this app: 
            <code>http://localhost:9887/app?repo=toothless/helloworld</code>. Clicking this link will redirect the user
            to the Toothless server on their host, which will take over the launch of the application. See the application
            booting section for details on how that works.</p>
